## Curriculum vitae from Web Developer

> Check my CV in [gh-pages](https://chato1337.github.io/frontend-cv/).

## Introduction

For any field of work it is essential to have a curriculum vitae, which allows us to publicize our skills, strengths and experience. The following project has two fundamental purposes, the first to fulfill its informative function for the labor field and the second to make known in a practical way the knowledge in software development technologies.

Continuing with the second point, it is intended to use a stack of modern and scalable technologies which have the support of the community and in most cases open source.

## Frontend technologies:

React Js: it is one of the most powerful and popular libraries for frontend development that is found today.

Sass: One of the most widely used css preprocessors today

## Other technologies used:

Vercel: ideal for the deployment of applications in javascript

Git and Github: for hosting the repository as well as version control and management

Dribble: as a source of inspiration for the development of the cv

## Structure

For the modeling of the data that will be brought from the backend and shown in frontend with react, sections are thought which represent a set of data shown below:

- initial information: which will include the full name, photo, phone number, email, location
- about me: a text paragraph with information relevant to the CV owner
- Work experience: a list with year title and respective description
- skills: a list of qualifying skills from 0 to 5 in total
- education: a list with year and studies carried out or in progress to date
- languages: a small graph showing the capacity in percentage for each language

## Conclusions:

the development of this small application has allowed me to put into practice my acquired knowledge and to refine through documentation the theoretical handling of it

## Appends

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
